a full stack todo list using java, javascript and H2 as a database

Created a basic API for todo to use for better understanding of dynamically creating a webpage using javascript. Started with a git call then dynamically created a table. After the table was created, added input field in form and value for the orignal form information. Then processed throug create, update and delete functionality.
