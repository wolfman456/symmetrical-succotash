# React Front End For Todo App :

Creating a reactjs front end for the current todo api which I already made a plan javescript front end for. 

## Goals : 
this project is to further my understanding of creating a react front end. By creating a table with full functional of 
previous plain javascript project.

## Project step :
1. Layout a table using react, original table will be created using static value only. 
2. create dummy buttons for create, delete and update.
3. adjust CSS for the table and buttons.
4. bring in real data through calls to established api
5. get create button working
6. get delete button working
7. get update button working
8. create unit test for this application. 

this is a ruff road map of expected steps, problem will likely occur along the way.
